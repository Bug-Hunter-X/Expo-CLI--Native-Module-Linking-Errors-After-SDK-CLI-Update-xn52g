This error typically occurs when there's a mismatch between the native modules used in your Expo project and the Expo SDK version you're targeting.  It often manifests when you update Expo CLI or SDK versions without properly updating or syncing the native modules within your project's iOS or Android folders.  The error message itself may vary, but it will usually point to problems within the native code compilation process.  For instance, you might see linker errors or errors related to missing headers or libraries.  Additionally,  if you've manually modified the native iOS/Android code, this modification might conflict with the newer Expo SDK version.
