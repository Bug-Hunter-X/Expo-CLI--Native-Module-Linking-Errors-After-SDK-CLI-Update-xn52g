The solution to this problem involves a series of steps designed to clean the build environment and ensure proper synchronization between your Expo project and its native modules.  Here's a breakdown of how to resolve this:

1. **Clean the project:** Remove any existing build artifacts, caches, and temporary files. For iOS, this involves removing the `ios/build` folder.  For Android, you will need to clear the gradle cache. You may also need to delete your node_modules directory and reinstall packages. 
2. **Clear the Expo cache:** Run `expo prebuild --clean` to remove any existing Expo build artifacts.
3. **Re-link native modules:** Use `expo prebuild` to re-link your native modules with the updated Expo SDK.  This may require modifying your Podfile for iOS and/or your Gradle files for Android, but, this step is usually automated by `expo prebuild`.
4. **Rebuild the project:** Run `expo start` again to initiate a fresh build process. 
5. **If problems persist:**  Check for any manual modifications within the `ios` and `android` folders that might be conflicting with the Expo SDK.  If you made custom changes, carefully review them and see if they are compatible with the current SDK.
